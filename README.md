# swiftclipse
Swift IDE support for Eclipse

Aims
====

Swift 2.0 is expected to be open-sourced during 2015, and will run on iOS,
OSX and Linux. This will allow open-source IDEs to be used to write Swift
programs.

To speed the adoption of Swift outside of the traditional OSX space, this
project aims to provide an IDE for developing Swift applications, where
the only requirement is a Swift compiler. This will allow code to be developed
outside of Xcode and OSX.

It is not a primary goal of this project to implement the full set of
functionality of Xcode, such as OSX or iOS specific libraries or Xcode specific
document formats such as Storyboards.

Contributor License Agreement
====

Since it is a long term goal for this project to be offered to the Eclipse
Foundation, please ensure that the Eclipse contributor license agreement
is signed and the commits use -s (Signed-off-by) before any pull requests 
will be merged.
